# Computational Musicology
For this course we were asked to analyse a music corpus using the Spotify API. The Spotify API has computes various features of music, that can be used for an analysis.

# The research
The main question for this analysis is: what makes a good Eurosongfestival song? The best EuroSongfestivals make it to the Grand Final. I have therefore chosen to analyse the songs that made it to the final (and won). One final contains around 26 songs, meaning I will analyse the last 38 finals. I want to see if there is a trend over time in songs that are succesfull.
